### Instructions

Start Prolog in the directory containing file `resolution0.pl`.
Type:

    | ?- consult(resolution0.pl)
    
    | ?- demo.
    
    | ?- demo2.
    
    | ?- demo3.
    
    | ?- demo4.

For every propositional formula F, the tests:  
                    
    | ?- tautology F.                               
    | ?- satisfiable F.    
                                             
always terminate with an answer yes/no.                            
You can also print a Conjunctive Normal Form:   
                   
    | ?- cnf F.             
                                            
The formula F can be built using propositional connectives:   
     
    not       (negation)                           
    and       (conjunction)                        
    or        (inclusive discjunction)             
    imp       (implication)                        
    rimp      (reversed implication)               
    equ       (equivalence, biconditional)         
    xor       (exclusive disjunction, not(p equ q))
    nand      (not(p and q))  - Sheffer's stroke  
    nor       (not(p or q))                        
    nimp      (not(p imp q))                       
    nrimp     (not(p rimp q))                      
    minus     (p and not q)  - the same as nimp    
     
truth constants: 

    true 
    false   
                        
and propositional symbols. 
As propositional symbol use identifiers starting with a lower-case letter. 

From strongest to weakest:

    not           
    and, or, nand, nor (left associative)
    imp, nrimp         (right associative)
    rimp, nimp, minus  (left associative)
    equ, xor.          (left associative)

Every connective has the same precedence and associativity type as its dual.
